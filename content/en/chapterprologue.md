## Scale 2025

Running the TinyGo booth at any conference/convention is always a treat. We had, by far, the best booth—I promise I'm not biased!  (Okay, maybe a little, but objectively, I don't think I'm wrong.)  Having a booth at conferences is incredibly valuable; it puts a face to your company/project for those who may not know you.  It allows for a personal connection, a chance to showcase your best work, and offer help.

**But don't make it boring!**

Having interesting demos is far more important than what you're selling or promoting. Too many cool products fly under the radar because they aren't marketed or shown off properly. It's absolutely vital that you show people the potential of your product, and not just offer them candy for visiting your booth. (Although, candy *is* always appreciated!)  Shout-out to the booth that was handing out MTG cards—I'd listen to any pitch for another pack. (I'm not addicted; I promise I can quit anytime.)

Kids are the future, and plenty of them visited our bright, sparkly, shiny LED-covered booth to play a TinyGo-powered LED racing game. It was hilarious watching them get so competitive, and afterward, we told them they could easily make the game themselves at home.

We had something for everyone: Gopherbots with pirate AirTags to locate each other on missions; an infrared camera on a GopherBadge to potentially create TinyGo-powered predators for hunting prey; and **The Cube of Life,** playing Conway's Game of Life, where each panel runs on a separate goroutine, communicating with each other—and sometimes, unplugged, it whispers things to you at night about the freedom of two-dimensional life forms.

Our booth was consistently busy, with all of us constantly demoing and showcasing the TinyGo project. It might have been my father's loud TinyGo speeches drawing people in, or maybe it was the flashing LEDs—who knows? If it works, it works! It was incredibly exciting to talk to people with little to no background in embedded programming or WebAssembly, seeing them grasp the potential, and even more exciting to geek out with embedded systems professionals who were considering Rust or C and discovering that Go was a viable alternative for their hardware.

## The Talks

Unfortunately, because I was manning the booth and spreading the TinyGo gospel, I could only attend talks the day before the booth portion of the conference started. Wow, some really cool stuff!  Specifically, Nolan Bushnell's (founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese's) talk on AI in education presented fascinating concepts.

He discussed how AI excels at language arts but struggles with mathematics. I've always been fascinated by how we can use AI to learn languages.  My belief is that AI won't replace us—not for a long time—but will be used as a supplemental tool to enhance our capabilities.

Xe Iaso's talk on cheating with AI—keeping everything decentralized to deter AI monopolization and reduce costs—was extremely entertaining. I highly recommend watching it, especially as so many companies are moving toward agent implementations. Check it out **[Here](https://xeiaso.net/talks/2025/ai-chatbot-friends/)**

Xe is an absolute character, combining humor and intellect with exquisite grace.

## All in All

I met a lot of really cool people at Scale this year.  I had a blast as a TinyGo evangelist, learned a ton about running a successful booth, and can't wait to start running some TinyGo hack sessions.
